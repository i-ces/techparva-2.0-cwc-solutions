# Title: That password again

Indra is not good at remembering his password. So he thought of writing it down in a sheet of paper. But he can't write it in plain text. So he had an idea to write his password without anyone else understanding it.

He wrote a list of strings. Each string when splitted into halves had a common character in it. When the common character from every entry in the list was joined he got his actual password.

Indra wanted an easy way to decipher his password. Can you help Indra in writing the program to decipher his password?
