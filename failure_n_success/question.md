# Title: Smooth AF

CWC has got a wild craze in the market. 100s of groups registered for the competition but only 10 of them made it out of the selection round. Team names are as follow:

Annapurna Bit Dhaulagiri Segfault Binary Quantum Glitch Titans ByteMe Lambda

The competition has started and the guys are on fire🔥. Each group has started submitting solutions to solve the various questions. Ofcourse, who won't want to title the competition after their name.

We as the organizers have collected the record of order in which each groups has submitted their solutions. After the competition is completed, we want to find out the team which has submitted the maximum solutions in a row, and largest number of solutions they submitted without interruption.

How about you help us with this? Afterall, you're also a nerd🧑‍💻.

```markdown
Only 6 submissions were recorded in the game, which were submitted by only two teams, Sagarmatha and Annapurna. Sagarmatha has managed to submit 3 solutions in a row, but Annapurna has managed to solve only one questions in a row. So, higest scoring team in a row is team "Sagarmatha" and the count is 3.
